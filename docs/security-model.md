# Security Model

v0.1 uses conservative governance boundaries:

- agents may not directly mutate `harness/prod`
- candidate harness changes belong under `harness/candidate`
- candidate skill changes belong under `skills/candidate`
- no sudo-capable autonomous agents are created
- runtime paths must be absolute
- cron, service, automation, and runtime changes follow discover-before-modify rules

External LLM endpoints are optional and should be treated as network dependencies. Do not place secrets in prompts or logs.
